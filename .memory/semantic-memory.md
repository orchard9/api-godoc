# Semantic Memory

## Project Facts
- PG GoAPI is an OpenAPI specification analyzer and documentation generator
- The project transforms endpoint-centric API specs into resource-centric documentation
- It is written in Go following elegant efficiency principles
- The tool generates markdown, JSON, and AI-optimized output formats
- It uses Mermaid syntax for resource relationship diagrams
- Mermaid diagrams visualize resources as nodes and relationships as labeled edges
- Relationship diagram arrows indicate strength: solid (-->) for strong, dashed (-.->) for medium/weak
- Pattern detection identifies 7 common API patterns: pagination, filtering, sorting, versioning, batch, search, auth
- Pattern confidence levels are based on example count: high (3+), medium (2), low (1)
- Patterns include impact statements to guide client implementation decisions
- Schema reduction supports three levels: essential, standard, and full
- Essential level keeps only required and key fields (id, name, email, type, status)
- Standard level filters technical fields (timestamps, metadata, internal fields)
- Schema reducer preserves nested objects if they contain essential fields
- Resource filtering supports include lists, exclude lists, and regex patterns
- Include filter overrides exclude filter when both are specified
- Resource filters use case-insensitive matching for include/exclude lists
- Multiple filters combine with OR logic for flexible targeting
- The project follows clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- It is designed as a single binary command-line tool
- The default output format is markdown
- The tool focuses on extracting business meaning from technical specifications
- It groups API endpoints by resources rather than listing them sequentially
- Resource detection uses path analysis and OpenAPI tags
- Relationship mapping identifies parent-child and reference connections
- Pattern recognition extracts common API patterns like pagination
- The tool is optimized for both human and AI consumption
- It follows the 90/10 principle: 90% of value in 10% of content
- The project is licensed under MIT license
- It targets OpenAPI 3.x specifications exclusively
- The tool needs Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.x conversion (critical - UAT examples use Swagger 2.0)
- The tool performs read-only analysis without modifying specs
- Both UAT examples (warden.v1.swagger.json, forge.swagger.json) are in Swagger 2.0 format
- Swagger 2.0 support is essential as many production APIs still use this legacy format
- The project includes example-output.md showing concrete sample outputs
- Tasks are organized by priority categories: Foundation, Core, Output, Enhancement, Quality
- Current project status is Pre-Alpha Development with documentation complete
- Test coverage achieved: 72.7% total, with critical components well tested
- Analyzer has 83.8% coverage, Reporter has 89.2% coverage
- All major components have comprehensive unit tests
- Real-world API fixtures include Stripe (6.8MB), GitHub (10.8MB), Kubernetes specs
- Performance benchmarks show 248 operations/sec for full pipeline processing
- Tool scales well: processes 216 resources from Stripe API in 632ms
- Production API validation ensures reliability with complex specifications
