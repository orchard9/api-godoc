Handles all major conversions: paths, parameters, responses, definitions→schemas, security.
Successfully converts both UAT examples (warden and forge) with full test coverage.
Properly transforms references (#/definitions/ → #/components/schemas/).

### 4. Create OpenAPI parser interface ✓
Implemented complete OpenAPI parser with support for file, URL, and stdin inputs.
Handles both JSON and YAML formats with automatic format detection.
Integrates seamlessly with Swagger converter for legacy specifications.
Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.x type definitions with full validation.

### 5. Implement basic OpenAPI 3.x parser ✓

Provides library-backed parsing with fallback to basic parser for edge cases.
Supports comprehensive OpenAPI 3.x validation and proper error handling.
Successfully validates both UAT examples with enhanced accuracy.

### 6. Create resource analyzer ✓
Implemented comprehensive resource extraction from OpenAPI paths.
ResourceAnalyzer detects business resources from path patterns and groups operations by resource.
Handles nested resources, filters out non-resource segments, and provides resource-centric analysis.
Successfully analyzed warden API (6 resources) and forge API (64 resources) with detailed operation mapping.

### 7. Design resource model structures ✓
Enhanced pkg/models/models.go with comprehensive data structures for API analysis.
Added detailed operation info (parameters, request/response bodies, security), field types with validation constraints.
Relationship model supports strength indicators and relationship types for sophisticated analysis.
Pattern detection includes confidence levels and impact assessment for better insights.

### 8. Implement relationship detection ✓
Created RelationshipDetector that analyzes API specs to identify resource relationships automatically.
Detects path hierarchy relationships (parent/child via nested paths), parameter-based foreign keys, and schema references.
Supports relationship types: has_many, belongs_to, references, referenced_by with strength indicators (strong/medium/weak).
Comprehensive test coverage validates detection algorithms and handles edge cases properly.

### 9. Create markdown reporter ✓
Implemented comprehensive Reporter with support for markdown, JSON, and AI-optimized output formats.
Markdown format includes API overview, statistics, resource tables, detailed operations, relationships, and patterns.
AI-optimized format provides condensed summary suitable for LLM context windows with key operations and relationships.
Fixed deprecated strings.Title usage with custom titleCase function for modern Go compatibility.

### 10. Create CLI with flags ✓
Implemented complete command-line interface with comprehensive flag support and full component integration.
CLI supports file and URL inputs, multiple output formats (markdown, JSON, AI), verbose logging, and file output.
Successfully integrated all components: parser, converter, analyzer, relationship detector, and reporter.
All UAT tests pass with real-world API specifications including warden and forge APIs.

### 13. Add Mermaid diagram generation ✓
Created resource relationship diagrams using Mermaid graph syntax for visual API understanding.
Diagrams show resources as nodes with relationships as labeled edges, using arrow styles to indicate strength.
Integrated into markdown reporter output with comprehensive test coverage validating diagram generation.
Successfully generates visual representations of complex API relationships in both UAT examples.

### 14. Implement pattern recognition ✓
Detected 7 common API patterns: pagination, filtering, sorting, versioning, batch operations, search, and authentication.
Pattern detector analyzes parameters, paths, and security schemes with confidence levels based on occurrence frequency.
Each pattern includes description, examples, and impact statements to guide client implementation.
Successfully identifies versioning and batch patterns in UAT examples with appropriate confidence levels.

### 15. Implement schema reduction ✓
Implemented three-level schema reduction: essential (minimal), standard (business), and full (everything).
Essential filters to required fields plus key identifiers; standard removes technical fields; full shows all.
Added --schema/-s CLI flag to control reduction level when extracting fields from component schemas.
Reducer intelligently preserves nested objects that contain essential fields for complete data representation.

### 16. Add resource filtering ✓
Implemented flexible resource filtering with include, exclude, and regex pattern support.
Added CLI flags: --include/-i (comma-separated), --exclude/-e (comma-separated), --filter (regex pattern).
Filters use OR logic when combined; include overrides exclude; case-insensitive matching for include/exclude.
Enables targeted documentation generation for specific resources or resource patterns.

### 12. Create AI-optimized format ✓
Created condensed format optimized for LLM context windows with key operations and relationships.
CLI flag -f ai produces streamlined output focusing on essential API information.
Format includes API stats, resource summaries with operation counts, and key CRUD operations.
Successfully reduces verbose API specs to digestible format for AI analysis and understanding.

### 20. Create example outputs through UAT ✓
Enhanced UAT process to generate sample documentation with format-specific file extensions.
Makefile dynamically processes any JSON files in uat/artifacts/ directory.
