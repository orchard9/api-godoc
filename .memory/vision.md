# Project Vision

## Core Vision
PG GoAPI aims to be the most effective OpenAPI documentation analyzer that transforms sprawling API specifications into clear, resource-centric documentation that developers and AI systems can actually understand.

## Design Principles
1. **Resource-First**: Group by business resources, not HTTP endpoints
2. **Signal Over Noise**: Extract 90% of value from 10% of content
3. **Developer Intuition**: Documentation that matches how developers think
4. **AI-Optimized**: Perfect context size for LLM consumption
5. **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately with sensible defaults

## Long-term Goals
- Become the standard tool for API comprehension and analysis
- Support all OpenAPI 3.x specifications seamlessly
- Enable rapid API understanding for onboarding and integration
- Maintain lightweight, single-binary distribution
- Build bridges between human and AI understanding of APIs

## Non-Goals
- API testing or mocking (documentation only)
- OpenAPI spec generation from code (analysis only)
- Multi-format input support (OpenAPI 3.x only)
- Real-time API monitoring (static analysis only)
- Spec modification or validation (read-only analysis)
